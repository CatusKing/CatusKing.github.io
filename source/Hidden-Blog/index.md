## 5/26

The is something sureal about having your deepest darkest secrets held on the internet publically but encryted. Idk I think it\'s cool.

## 4/25

ok so like i probably have given myself a drug dependency on weed. also like tonight like over 5000 emotions hit at once. not to mention today i felt "clear headed" when in actuality i was just having a manic episode so thats cool. my head wants to do anything and everything thats productive while my body is running off of 4 hours of sleep and really wants to rest. i feel like im dying but at the same time today was the "best mental health day in a while" even though i have already realized im in a manic episode. i can still feel all the depression and shit while also feeling really happy. all i want to do right now is smoke some weed and not feel anything at all. instead i feel an immense amount of all of the following emotions: guilt, sadness, depression, happiness, productivity, motivation, lack of motivation, lack of excitement to do anything i love, love, helplessness, weakness, emptiness, and many more. am i crazy? idk what else to write but thats me rn as of 4/25/2022 12:52 am est

added with Disassociating to the point where i perseve all my online friends as a part of my phone rather then like actually people in the way that like its really hard for me emotionally to put irl and online together if that makes sense? like i love all of you guys and logically you guys are real people but in my head youre just pixels on a screen and emotionally i could just do the most mean and manipulative things in the world but logically i dont. idk maybe im having a mental break but like... it feels like nothing is real

## 3/15

hi, uhm well i had to do this for so many reasons so let me list them.

 - I need a place to vent
 - I can\'t vent on my main page bc my therrapist reads it
 - I want to be able to submit this to college and I can\'t talk about drugs if I do that

anyways if i let you see this then i trust you <3.

### Vent

{% spoiler ok to start with i used up a whole cart in less than a week. also not to mention that i fucking was hitting mostly at home but i also hit it at school. anyways my mental health is in the gutters. ive attempted twice in less than a week. sadly didnt work. physically i am quite possibly dying from the amount of pills i took from both attempts. i can barely stand and im costantly disoriented. like if i stand up too quick or spin i get darker vision. %}
