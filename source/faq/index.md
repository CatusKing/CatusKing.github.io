#### What are your pronouns?

You can check them out **[here](https://en.pronouns.page/@CatusKing)**

#### What are your boundaries?

Compliments are fine.
Don't ask me what's in my pants
Please don\'t expect immediate responses as I may take a couple of hours/days to see the message.

#### What\'s your gender?

Maverique[^1] because it\'s simple but confussing.

#### What\'s your sexuality?

I identify as pansexual due to the fact that I don\'t like how bisexual doesn\'t include trans\* people in most definitions.

#### When are you most active?

Really anytime I'm not in school!

#### How's the best way to reach you?

By dming me on discord(CatusKing#2624) or emailing(button on the left).

#### What coding languages do you know?

I mostly know Java, CSS, html, and Javascript but I\'ve also touched Typescript, Python, and C#

#### Any tips to new developers?

Well it depends because I am a self taught dev. Meaning I never took a course. I just copy and pasted code. I would then play with the example code until I understood what I was doing. I later then learned how to read documentation which is a huge help to any dev. If you\'re looking to learn without experimenting then I\'m not the person to ask. But if you\'re willing to experiment I suggest writing basic js scripts as a start. Make a simple chat bot. Incorporate some api\'s like discord. Learn to use a lib like discord.js or even better a package manager like npm.

#### What have you programed in the past?

Well you can find anything I\'ve made on my [GitHub](https://github.com/CatusKing). Other then that not much other then some side projects.

[^1]: Maverique (pronounced mav-reek) is a specific nonbinary gender identity "characterized by autonomy and inner conviction regarding a sense of self that is entirely independent of male/masculinity, female/femininity or anything which derives from the two while still being neither without gender nor of a neutral gender." Maverique is not close to a female or male gender, and is not like a mix of them; the identity goes beyond the entire scope of the gender binary or any identities within and outside of it. It is independent of the entire concept of the gender binary, including other non-binary identities that are derived from comparison with binary genders. It also isn't a lack of gender, or an apathetic attitude about gender. Maverique is strictly a gender identity, not a gender expression, so "how a maverique person chooses to express or present themselves is entirely up to that individual." Maverique is not an umbrella term, but a specific gender identity.
