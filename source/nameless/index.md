## Server Currency

### ❓ How do I get money?

*You can make +5🦴 points per minute of messaging. This use's a cooldown system that starts a 1 minute cooldown on point gain.*

*Spending 1 minute in vc will give you +2🦴 points. If you are not muted you will instead get a total of +5🦴 points. If you are not muted and use camera you will get a total +8🦴 points. If you can not use your camera you can instead screenshare while unmuted to get a total of +6🦴 points.*

*Participating in events will earn you huge quantities of points!*

*Counting in the counting channel gives you +5🦴 per everytime you count but everytime it's a new high score it gives you +50🦴!*

### ❓ What does vip do?

*Vip gives a 1.5x bonus on anything that is activity based. ie. spending time in vc or send messages*

## Streaks

### ❓ Why do some of the messages I send get fire emojis and others don\'t?

*Well that would be our streak system implemented through the nameless bot. Every 24 hours you send a message your daily streak will increase by one. Use /streak to keep track of your current streak and /streaks to see the rewards.*

### ❓ Why do some messages get bone reactions with the streak reaction?

*If you hit a daily streak goal you will be rewarded with bones. The bone reaction just notifies you of the rewards.*
