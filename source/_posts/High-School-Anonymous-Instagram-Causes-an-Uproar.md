It started with an Instagram account where a student could submit photos of their fellow classmates sleeping. The anonymous account holder would then share these photos publicly putting them on display. Little did the student know this trend would blow up in the school. With over 6 different accounts all anonymousingly being created, this very quickly became a trend within a week. As a person who was posted on the hse[^1] couples account I felt violated. Not only because someone is sneaking photos of me but also because I feel like I can do nothing about the photo's existence. We asked the hse[^1] couples account for a statement. When asked if posting these photos of others without their consent is a violation of their privacy they said:

> ummm. i mean no. cause they at school. and it is a school page lol.

The sheer lack of understanding of how others may feel uncomfortable shows the lack of maturity of the person who runs this account. They are also breaking the law and school rules by doing something illegal on school grounds.

Keep in mind that every platform has a different privacy policy, so the individual that posts may think they did nothing wrong.”

The fact that not only are they breaking law but also school rules without a care shows how this can easily get so much worse. On the hse[^1] crushes account they posted on their story asking if instead of crushes they should share others secrets. This just goes to show how this can quickly go from creepy inappropriate talk about minors to cyber bullying on a large scale. I reached out to hse[^1] crushes account in which they declined to comment on the current situation.

Special thanks to Zach and Joanna for helping me with this one!
