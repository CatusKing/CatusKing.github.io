## Mental Health

My mental health is in the dumps. I\'ve started being super impulsive lately. I pierced my own ears with my friends. At least that was something I wanted to do. Tbh I\'ve lost all motivation to actually take care of myself. It\'s all too much work. I don\'t have the motivation to focus on school or anything really.

## Ukraine

Now ofc if you\'re reading this as it was published you are well aware what\'s currently happening but if you\'re reading back then well hi. Ukraine is being invaded by Russia. The current death toll is about 2000 civilians killed by Russian forces.I haven\'t been keeping myself up to date with everything so I will not go into detail but I thought some current events are due here.
