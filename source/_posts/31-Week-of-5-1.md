## Mental Health

I\'m so tired. I keep falling asleep in my classes. Other than that a pretty normal week. I got a developer job so that\'s good.

## I got chassed by school security

I was having a panic attack in school so I went to steped outside. While I was outside a teacher walked over and just clossed the door on me. Because of that I freaked out. Security asked me why I was outside and told me i had to go through the main entrance. But since I was freaking out I decided to go to the library accross the street. The security the walked after as I went to the library though. It\'s funny because my dad doesnt believe me that I was having a panic attack.
