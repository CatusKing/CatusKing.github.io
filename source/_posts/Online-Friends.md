## The problem with online friends

Ok this may sound weird but I have too many good friends that it\'s bad for my mental health. Let\'s start with the fact that I love making friends and I love getting to know people. This absolutly sucks when you already have so many online friends that are absolutly amazing to you.

## A message to all of my online friends

Let me start with I\'m sorry. My name is Thomas if you didn\'t know that btw. I\'ve recently came to the conclussion that I\'m a horrible online friend for the one reason that you guys are all so amazing and that I don\'t have enough time to vc with all of you. I would absolutly love to spend all day in vc with each and everyone of you but TIME. Like I love you guys so so so much and I hate the fact that I can\'t always call wiith you guys but yk if you call me I WILL ALWASY PICK UP. You guys are all the best and i just lost motivation to write so byt until I update this.
