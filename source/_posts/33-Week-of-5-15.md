## Mental Health

Last week I had an intense manic episode ending with the begging of this week being supper down. We love that. Now it is Tuesday and I\'m starting to feel manic again and it isn\'t fun. 

Poof it is Friday now. I had to leave school early bc mentally and physically I wasn\'t feeling the best. Right now I\'m at joanna\'s house and mentally I just feel fidgety.
