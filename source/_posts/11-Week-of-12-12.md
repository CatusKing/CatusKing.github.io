# My First News Article

Well, this week was rather interesting. I don't know whether to start with my depression or getting posted on the hse[^1] couples account. Let's start with the less interesting so you can understand how the hse couples account affected me. My depression for the last three weeks has been absolutely horrible. It's gotten so bad it's to the point of not having any motivation to get any classwork or homework done. Added with some other personal problems I've been recently dealing with and you get a recipe for disaster. When I had found out that I had been posted on the hse couples account, I felt both violated and creeped out at the same time. Not only are people taking random pictures of me and my s/o in the halls but I feel as if asking them to take down the photo is a waste of time. I ended up hyperfixating on making the news article I posted before this. Though it was written very quickly and is very short it came out fairly well. The point of the piece was to insight conversation over the topic and I hope that's what I accomplished.
