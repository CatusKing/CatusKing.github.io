## I\'m in san salvador!

I\'m writing this as of 11-20 12:22 am. It\'s late so I\'ll be quick. Uhm we took the plane which had a bit of a rough landing, but otherwise was fine. Then we took this wonky looking bus to the hotel I\'m currently writing this in.

Ok starting here I\'m going to make a log of my trip

## El Salvador Trip

Ok we started off leaving school early which was good because I got to miss my math test. Then we went to the airport around 2 ish.
