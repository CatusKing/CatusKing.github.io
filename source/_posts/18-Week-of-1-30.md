## Mental Health

This week started off being really low on Sunday and Monday. I\'m writing this Tuesday. Today isn\'t the worst so far but it\'s by no means what my mental health should be. Though my motivation to code again is going up my motivation to do homework is still nonexistent. I really wish I had a sense of how my mental health would progress so I could know whether to prepare for the worst or starting pushing myself again. 

I\'m writing this as of Thursday and may I say I feel like shit. I don\'t know if I can consider this an all time low but It\'s very close. I\'ve been considering skipping classes. I don\'t see a point in actually going. I can\'t focus nor can I actually do my work. All I want to do right now is be home sleeping.

## Bitcoin Mining

I\'ve been bitcoin mining for the last couple of months on my old laptop and current laptop. That\'s a 1050 ti and 3060 both mining and I\'ve made about $41 dollars from intermittently mining. I hope to just mine 24/7 in the future. As of right now bitcoin is a buy market due to the recent crash down to 30k per coin but I\'m hoping to just stop mining when it goes back to 60k. Either way I don\'t plan on mining for long as the side effects of crypto networks on society is horrendous due to the pure amount of electricity all the servers draw. Especially due to the fact that my mining rig is not power efficient at all. This is because the rigs are in a small form factor so heat has a hard time escaping. This means the fans have to work overtime both effecting the efficiency and power consumption. 

## Current Event - [Trump promises to ban transgender women from sports if re-elected](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/trump-promises-ban-transgender-women-sports-re-elected-rcna14248)

### Summary

During a rally in Texas trump recently stated that if he was elected president that he would ban "men"(Trans women) from playing sports with cis women. Trump not only misgendered them on purpose but also stated that “If this does not change, women’s sports as we know it will die.” The article states that the reason that trans women are such a big topic at the moment is that conservatives want to wedge "red meat" to the polls by threatening women sports.

### Opinion

I think that it is insane that this is still being used to push people to the polls as this has been used by conservatives for the last 2 years already. This is becoming more and more of a social issue as some of the new regulations require trans women to have lower T[^1] levels. This is forcing trans women to take T blockers even if they don\'t want to. The rules also state that they need to have the lower T levels for at least 36 months in advance. I understand why this is such a huge issue right now but in my opinion, the male and female sports are going to disappear anyway. A binary sports system built on a now growing non-binary gender system is destined to fail. We are slowly getting closer to a non-binary based gender system where people can be who they are without having to conform to only two genders. This means that having a binary sports system will eventually have no use as more and more people consider themselves as non-gender-conforming or trans*.
