## Mental Health

Really really bad. Mood swings! I took wednesday and thursday off from school. As of friday I feel ok for once.

## My First Ever Concert

On wednesday I\'m going to my first ever concert! Even better it\'s a [Conan Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_Gray) concert. To be honest I\'m not feeling good both mentally and physically so we will see how it goes. I didn\'t end up going for mental health reasons and personal physical health reasons.
