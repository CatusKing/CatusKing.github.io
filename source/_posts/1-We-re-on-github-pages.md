[![Node.JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.JS-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white&labelColor=101010)](https://nodejs.org/)Ok so now I have my test server for this blog home hosted and the main on github pages. I will probably update about every week idk we will see. Hopefully I don\'t forget about this project! My goals for this weekend is to maybe find an api for this website. Idk maybe I\'ll advertise this on my discord. Non the less I\'m very excited to start some new projects.
