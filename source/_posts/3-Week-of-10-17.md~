I\'m going to start writing plans for the upcoming week to stay more organized. Also rip my spelling because the editor I use doesn\'t have spell check. Anyways on sunday I am moving so I don\'t see myself getting much done. As for the rest of the week based on motivation we\'ll see how much of nameless I can colsolidate to seperate files.

All we are doing in class is going over &&, ||, and if else statements. It\'s all too basic!
