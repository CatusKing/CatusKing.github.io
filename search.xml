    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="My-First-News-Article"><a href="#My-First-News-Article" class="headerlink" title="My First News Article"></a>My First News Article</h1><p>Well, this week was rather interesting. I don’t know whether to start with my depression or getting posted on the hse<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> couples account. Let’s start with the less interesting so you can understand how the hse couples account affected me. My depression for the last three weeks has been absolutely horrible. It’s gotten so bad it’s to the point of not having any motivation to get any classwork or homework done. Added with some other personal problems I’ve been recently dealing with and you get a recipe for disaster. When I had found out that I had been posted on the hse couples account, I felt both violated and creeped out at the same time. Not only are people taking random pictures of me and my s/o in the halls but I feel as if asking them to take down the photo is a waste of time. I ended up hyperfixating on making the news article I posted before this. Though it was written very quickly and is very short it came out fairly well. The point of the piece was to insight conversation over the topic and I hope that’s what I accomplished.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Happy-new-fear"><a href="#Happy-new-fear" class="headerlink" title="Happy new fear!"></a>Happy new fear!</h2><p>With covid rates soaring high I&#39;m in school as of 1/3/2022. You wanna know a fun fact? Our current covid 7-day average is almost 2 times higher then the highest peak before this omnicron outbreak. This is all added with the CDC&#39;s new guidelines that is confusing the public. The new 5 day rule is supposed to be made for front line health care workers. But the public eager to spread the disease is ignoring that and taking the 5-days fro themselves. Also I forgot to comment on the horrible joke that is this sections title. To be honest it goes best not commented on. Personally I really despise setting goals for mysself for the new year as I find I tend not to do them if I set them as my goal.</p>
<h2 id="My-mental-state-is-non-exsistant"><a href="#My-mental-state-is-non-exsistant" class="headerlink" title="My mental state is non-exsistant"></a>My mental state is non-exsistant</h2><p>tw<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>: anxiety, panic attacks, depersonalization, and depression</p>

  <span class="spoiler" onclick="this.classList.toggle('spoiler')">
    <span class="spoiler-blur ">Well recently has been a bundle of fun. I can&#39;t tell the difference between my dreams and reality. I’ve recently been having dreams where I lose all my friends and because of this recent depersonalization I can go for hours in the morning not realizing it was all a dream. Also added with these mini panic attacks I&#39;ve been having that aren&#39;t bad but make it so I can&#39;t sleep. It just feels like a wave of anxiety is holding my eyes wide open rather than letting me sleep. I really hope these problems stop bothering me as break just ended and I need to be able to focus on school work again. All of this is happening in my head while I still need to be there for my friends as 3 of them tried to commit in the span of 2 days.</span>
  </span>

<h2 id="School"><a href="#School" class="headerlink" title="School"></a>School</h2><p>I&#39;m still behind on pretty much all of my school work and class work. It&#39;s hard to even keep up on my work anymore. To be honest it&#39;s not that it&#39;s hard to keep up on the work. It&#39;s just hard to get the motivation to get started let alone complete the work. I&#39;m planning on trying to complete all my work assigned to me starting today to febuary break. That&#39;s my goal as of right now. If I can complete this I&#39;ll move towards focusing on raising my grade.</p>
<h2 id="CSA"><a href="#CSA" class="headerlink" title="CSA"></a>CSA</h2><p>I hate CSA and my CSA teacher. Like why do I need to write my code by hand for the AP. Like what?!?! Why can&#39;t they give us at least a sandboxed computer. Like it&#39;s not that hard. Added with no partial credit for anything that&#39;s not in the “scope” of the AP. Like using .endswith on a String is not in the “scope”. It seems that this AP course would rather teach developers to go through the whole understanding of everything rather than using methods. This is great for them but since I already have expereince in software development I find this extremely boring. Also I finially figured out why I hate my teacher so so so much. It&#39;s because he&#39;ll see a student doing something a little wrong and crack a joke about it <em>tw caps</em> 
  <span class="spoiler" onclick="this.classList.toggle('spoiler')">
    <span class="spoiler-blur ">AND THEN CONTINUE TO BE THE ONLY ONE TO LAUGH AT HIS OWN JOKE TOWARDS THE STUDENT. LIKE WHAT KIND OF PSYCHOPATH LAUGHS AT HIS OWN JOKES THAT DEGRADES STUDENTS.</span>
  </span> Anyways asides from being rude towards his students he&#39;s an ok teacher.</p>

    <title>4. Week of 10-24</title>
    <url>/2021/10/25/4-Week-of-10-24/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Reading"><a href="#Reading" class="headerlink" title="Reading!"></a>Reading!</h2><p><strong>TW<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> // Transphobia<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> // Hate Crimes</strong></p>
<h3 id="Chapter-1"><a href="#Chapter-1" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 1"></a>Chapter 1</h3><p>This week I focused more on reading rather than coding. Currently, I&#39;m reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Transgender-History-second-Revolution-Studies-ebook/dp/B0716GZ8GG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1635164549&sr="><em>Transgender History</em> by Susan Stryker</a>. Something that I had learned from the terms and definitions section located in chapter 1 is that using MtF<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and FtM<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> tends to be dehumanizing. It&#39;s better to rather refer to transgender and non-genderconformative people as trans*<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, trans-women, trans-men, etc. I love being able to learn new terms as not only does it allow me to explore my gender identity but respect others. The difference between gender and sex is a huge misconception. Sex in most cases refers towards the biological identity of a person, while gender is more cultural and based on how the person wants to identify. It is very important to respect anyone&#39;s gender identity. Though only cis-gender<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> people seem to get respect towards their gender identity. One of the biggest takeaways I had just from chapter 1 was that the confusion between sex and gender is what most often leads to transphobia.</p>
<h3 id="Chapter-2"><a href="#Chapter-2" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 2"></a>Chapter 2</h3><p>After reading chapter 2 other than learning the history portion of what they talked about I found this particular section about Prince from 1961 interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and avoided serving prison time by accepting five years of probation, during which time she agreed to refrain from public cross-dressing and from using the mail for indecent purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this to be outrageous. This is crazy to me for two main reasons. For one to stop cross-dressing in 1961 was not that common and was more widely accepted. Two, the reason the probation includes “…and from using mail for indecent purposes.” is because Prince ran an erotic magazine called <em>Transvestia</em>. But this shows the level of transphobia because playboy magazines started in 1953 yet they got no bans from the mailing service.</p>
<h3 id="Chapter-3"><a href="#Chapter-3" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 3"></a>Chapter 3</h3><p><strong>TW<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> // Sexual Abuse // Sexual Assault // Police Brutality</strong></p>
<p>There is way way way too much in this chapter just to cover in 1 summary but something that struck me was this quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The police could be especially vicious to &quot;street queens,&quot; whom they considered bottom-of-the-barrel sex workers and who were the least able to complain about mistreatment. Transgender women working the streets were often arrested on suspicion of prostitution even if they were just going to the corner store or talking with friends; 
  <span class="spoiler" onclick="this.classList.toggle('spoiler')">
    <span class="spoiler-blur ">they might be driven around in squad cars for hours, forced to perform oral sex, strip-search, or, after arriving at the jail, humiliated in front of other prisoners.</span>
  </span> Transgender women in jail often would have their heads forcibly shaved or, if they resisted, be placed in solitary confinement in &quot;the hole.&quot; And because they were legally men (with male genitalia in spite of their social lives as women, and often in spite of having breasts and no facial hair) they would be placed in the men&#39;s jail, 
  <span class="spoiler" onclick="this.classList.toggle('spoiler')">
    <span class="spoiler-blur ">where their femininity made them especially vulnerable to sexual assault, rape, and murder.</span>
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I honestly just find this to be absolutely horrifying as a person who cross-dresses in the sense of painting my nails. This type of treatment towards &quot;street queens&quot; only made them louder surprisingly. I hate how not only men in the prison but police officers who are supposed to protect people harassed trans* just for being and showing who they are. I just wish that the trans* people were treated with the same respect that cisgender people get.</p>

The bot&#39;s purpose is to allow random mebers of any server quote anything someone else says using slash commands. The bot as of right now is pretty fleshed out when it comes to code and as well is a very simple bot. I think I&#39;m going to try using ts for this bot the next time I update it. The links for the bot are as follows. <a href="http://quotes.catusking.com/">Bot Invite</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/YEYbkYAhqm">Discord Invite</a>.

<h2 id="El-Salvador"><a href="#El-Salvador" class="headerlink" title="El Salvador"></a>El Salvador</h2><p>I&#39;m going on a trip for the next 10 days starting the friday of this week</p>
<h2 id="My-Gender"><a href="#My-Gender" class="headerlink" title="My Gender"></a>My Gender</h2><p>Ahhhhh I&#39;m questiong my gender again. So I&#39;m definitally nb<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and trans*, but what I&#39;am specifically I&#39;m not too sure. I did some looking around at gender labels and I think I found one that might fit me. I like the label Maverique<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I like how it&#39;s a mixture and self defined. If I can I would like to try opening up about this to my friends and see if they support me. If so i might start using it when i sign up online and maybe eventually change my legal id. Right now I&#39;m just focussed on learning who I am. If I can I would love to bring more social awareness to the diffrence between gender identity, gender expression, and sex. I love the fact that Maverique doesn&#39;t set any expectations on gender expression, as it only defines gender identity. I think the distiction between gender identity and expession is widely understood. The only problem is for people who aren&#39;t well educated in the trans community. They tend to not know the diffrence between sex and gender. While gender is self-defined, sex is rather something that more definded by body parts and x y chromosomes. One of the biggest problems when it comes to the undersatnding of pronouns and gender is the clear diffrence between them. Just becuase I identify as nb doesn&#39;t mean that I need to have Non-Gender specific pronouns. I personally use the pronouns they/him but I currently identify as nb.</p>

It is defined as an identity that is not the absence of gender, or an apathy towards gender, but a present feeling of gender. This feeling of gender is completely independent from male, female, neutral, or anything derived from any of them. However, maveriques can be multigender with their other genders being related to maleness, femaleness, or neutrality. <a href="https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Maverique">ref</a></span><a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote"> ↩</a></li></ol></div></div>]]></content>

    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="I-39-m-in-san-salvador"><a href="#I-39-m-in-san-salvador" class="headerlink" title="I&#39;m in san salvador!"></a>I&#39;m in san salvador!</h2><p>I&#39;m writing this as of 11-20 12:22 am. It&#39;s late so I&#39;ll be quick. Uhm we took the plane which had a bit of a rough landing, but otherwise was fine. Then we took this wonky looking bus to the hotel I&#39;m currently writing this in.</p>
<p>Ok starting here I&#39;m going to make a log of my trip</p>
<h2 id="El-Salvador-Trip"><a href="#El-Salvador-Trip" class="headerlink" title="El Salvador Trip"></a>El Salvador Trip</h2><h3 id="Day-1"><a href="#Day-1" class="headerlink" title="Day 1"></a>Day 1</h3><h4 id="Evening"><a href="#Evening" class="headerlink" title="Evening"></a>Evening</h4><p>Ok we started off leaving school early which was good because I got to miss my math test. Then we went to the airport around 2 ish.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1Lfs2NIm.jpg" alt="Air Strip"><br>We got on the plane around 5 ish and took off around 5:50. I was able to catch up on some reading on the plane. I read both the <em>Transgender History</em> and <em>A raisin in the sun</em>. They are both really good books and it was nice to be able to have some reading time. The seat didn&#39;t recline though so that was a huge pain in my neck. <em>ha ha</em>… Anyways once we got to the airport we had to go through customs and imigartion. Imigration took a hot minute but customs literally just looked at us and then said we can go without even checking our bags so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VlxRi5vm.jpg" alt="Airport"><br>Once we got outside I quickly realized this is going to be a very hot trip. It was about 28 degrees C when we landed and it was about 10:30 pm soooo…(NOT TO MENTION THE 90% HUMIDITY) We then went to the airport parking lot to go to our bus. Let me just say the bus was rather interesting…<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QlR8jYNm.jpg" alt="Photo of the bus"><br>I don&#39;t know why but to me the bus honestly looks so funny. I think it&#39;s just the way the bus looks so flat on the front.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3f6yhoDm.jpg" alt="Outside the Hotel"><br>The hotel was rather nice. Check in was fairly easy. We went to sleep around 11:30 ish. The room was actually really nice and pretty big.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Yp5ECMim.jpg" alt="Hotel Room"></p>
<h3 id="Day-2"><a href="#Day-2" class="headerlink" title="Day 2"></a>Day 2</h3><h4 id="Morning"><a href="#Morning" class="headerlink" title="Morning"></a>Morning</h4><p>Breakfast though was amazing. I&#39;m so conflicted on wheather to think this hotel is fancy or not. The food was really good and the second I finished one of the staff took my plat away which scared me. This was a normal self serve hotel so it was kinda weird to me for staff to take my plate. Anyways the food was amazing but the yogurt was so cool. I think it was hand made but idk.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WBc4SUHm.jpg" alt="Breakfast"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LX5Xu24m.jpg" alt="Yogurt"><br>The green yogurt was a coconut one and it was very delicious. The others we ok but I really did love the coconut one. I&#39;m writing Day&#39;s 1-2 at the moment in the morning of day 2 so I don&#39;t have much more to write. Right now we&#39;re just sitting outside the hotel by the pool and trying to figure out what our plan is today. We will be leaving to the beach soon. I&#39;m very much not excited for that as it&#39;s already 32(91 F) degrees C.</p>
<h4 id="Noon"><a href="#Noon" class="headerlink" title="Noon"></a>Noon</h4><p>Ok I got on the bus and I&#39;m kinda bored so I&#39;m writing this now. Right before I got in the van I got attacked by tons of red ants. Let me tell you it is nit fun to look down and find 20 or so red ants bitting your foot.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wtaPbIOm.jpg" alt="Pink Wall"><br>Something that is interesting is how many walls there are here. Pretty much any building of buiness has armed guards and walls with barbed wire. Anyways something I plan on doing when the new minecraft version comes out is building this image.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2KD0kbMm.jpg" alt="San Miguel"><br>I love how the buildings look and with the mountain in the background. Ahhh I&#39;m in love.</p>
<h4 id="Evening-1"><a href="#Evening-1" class="headerlink" title="Evening"></a>Evening</h4><p>Ok so first off it&#39;s very hard to concentrate when you&#39;re in a full van of hispanics clubbin gin the van but yk we vibe. Anyways after this I&#39;ll check up on trevorspace. For now I&#39;m on a four hour bus/van ride to San Miguel. So the appetizer was rather interesting once we got to the food place.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oTHsFULm.jpg" alt="Weird Fried Food"><br>The food was still good though. Whatever crusation I ate just tasted like shrimp. Anyways the view were stunning.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2iwknull.jpg" alt="Amazing Ocean View"><br>oh… we are in the van at like a gas station right now and one of my family members mentioned how the place that we just ate at the workers get paid $5 per DAY?!??!?!? Anyways little money aside here&#39;s a video of what the hell is happening in the bus/van at the moment.<br>Sad the video has no audio. Well imagine hispanic club music at full blast and max bass with the whole fam screaming. we vibe ヽ(⌐■_■)ノ♪♬ Cringe aside I&#39;m going to turn off my laptop and sing with the fam. If you&#39;ve read up to this well I guess that&#39;s kinda cool. Thank you &lt; 3</p>
<p>Omg I had an idea while I was singing and what if google drive. Well it works so heres what were up to.</p>

<h4 id="Later-Evening"><a href="#Later-Evening" class="headerlink" title="Later Evening"></a>Later Evening</h4><p>Ok for one I felt like I was going to die on the ride no joke. The driver kept a constant speed of 80 mph and if there was anyone infront of us he would go into the oncoming traffic lane. let me just say we had some close calls. At the moment I&#39;m in a hotel writing this. Our plane for tommorow is to eat around 9 ish but I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s already 11:38 pm so I&#39;ll have to be quick with this. So once we got to San Miguel we went to my tia&#39;s house and let me just say wow…  It&#39;s fancy as hell(for a third wrold country).<br><a href="https://imgur.com/BD6w8MB"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BD6w8MBm.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br><a href="https://imgur.com/XUQlRd0"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XUQlRd0m.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br>The pool is really nice. Anyways I&#39;m going to go to bed in this sketch hotel room. gn<br><a href="https://imgur.com/xBnZfh2"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xBnZfh2m.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br><a href="https://imgur.com/VEUEgf6"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VEUEgf6m.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>
<h3 id="Day-3"><a href="#Day-3" class="headerlink" title="Day 3"></a>Day 3</h3><h4 id="Morning-1"><a href="#Morning-1" class="headerlink" title="Morning"></a>Morning</h4><p>The food was pretty good. I just realized that I forgor to take a photo of it smh my head. Anyways so atm I&#39;m back in the hotel room waiting to go to Darwins Ranch. Aparently Darwin is a sugarcane farmer, which is really cool.</p>
<h4 id="Noon-to-Evening"><a href="#Noon-to-Evening" class="headerlink" title="Noon to Evening"></a>Noon to Evening</h4><p>I didn&#39;t get any sugar cane which is fine but i did get some cool drone shots! Here&#39;s a sneak peak as I&#39;ll only be able to send get them off the sd card when I get home.<br><a href="https://imgur.com/80r3Tt9"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/80r3Tt9m.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br>Oh and I think that&#39;s the furthest I&#39;ve ever gone. 2100 meters! Anyways I learned that Darwin&#39;s ranch is sustanible and that he grows corn as well. Here&#39;s some spam of what the ranch looked like.<br><a href="https://imgur.com/Qd3GPM9"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qd3GPM9m.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br><a href="https://imgur.com/G6D5u4g"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/G6D5u4gm.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br><a href="https://imgur.com/dDIHd6G"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dDIHd6Gm.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br><a href="https://imgur.com/GfzRYeY"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GfzRYeYm.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br><a href="https://imgur.com/CeTjA77"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CeTjA77m.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br><a href="https://imgur.com/fayo6pJ"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fayo6pJm.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br><a href="https://imgur.com/aD8OLHZ"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aD8OLHZm.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a><br><a href="https://imgur.com/6xi2DCA"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6xi2DCAm.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>

Anyways yesterday the ride back from the farm was loud otherwise I had a really nice time.</p>
<h4 id="Noon-1"><a href="#Noon-1" class="headerlink" title="Noon"></a>Noon</h4><p>We took the bus/van to the memorial for mami candie memorial. It was very nice and for privacy reasons and respectful reasons I will not be sharing details or photos.</p>

I think I am dissociation or whatever. Either way I am having some sort of breakdown. I called Joanna and felt better. I almost got kidnapped too! I was on the beach alone and a biker kept driving towards me with their headlight only turning on every now and then to see. After that I essentially was really tired and went to sleep.</p>

<h4 id="Evening-4"><a href="#Evening-4" class="headerlink" title="Evening"></a>Evening</h4><p>We went to visit my mom&#39;s house where she was born and grew up til the age of 4. After that we went back to my tia&#39;s and got on the <em>party bus</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> because some of the family had to get a covid test to back to the us. We will prob get our test tmrw. We went back to tia&#39;s after everyone else got the test. I&#39;ve gotten sick by drinking something so stomach pains are a normal for me now.

<h3 id="Trip-Summary"><a href="#Trip-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Trip Summary"></a>Trip Summary</h3><p>Going to El Salvador is a trip I will never forget. It was so beautiful and amazing. Sadly it had to be for a funeral for me to meet so much of my family but either way it was nice to meet them and see where my mom grew up. I hope once I get the drone fotage uploaded and edited I will have an amzing video to remeber this trip. Not to mention this blog which will imortalize it forever.

    <title>9. Week of 11-28</title>
    <url>/2021/12/07/9-Week-of-11-28/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="yay-i-fell-behind-on-everything"><a href="#yay-i-fell-behind-on-everything" class="headerlink" title="yay i fell behind on everything"></a>yay i fell behind on everything</h2><p>As you may be able to tell by the date for this week I&#39;m not wrtiing this the week of so instead of recapping that week I&#39;ll just instead go with my backup plan. So I&#39;m going to write down what a day with severe depression during a depressive episode is like for me.</p>
<h3 id="Waking-up"><a href="#Waking-up" class="headerlink" title="Waking up"></a>Waking up</h3><p>I wake up tired as hell and I feel like it&#39;s impossible to get out of bed. Once I get the motivation to get out of bed I end up having to rush to get my stuff together. <em>If</em> I make the bus then I&#39;ll get on the bus and play the game don&#39;t fall asleep. The reason I&#39;m so tired is because of the depressive episode. No matter how much sleep I get I will always be tired.</p>
<h3 id="Periods-1-3"><a href="#Periods-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Periods 1-3"></a>Periods 1-3</h3><p>These are the easiest periods of the day as it&#39;s English, AP CSA 1, and Exploration in Compsci. It&#39;s nice to start the day slow as it let&#39;s me wake up and prepare for the rest of the day.</p>
<h3 id="Periods-4-9"><a href="#Periods-4-9" class="headerlink" title="Periods 4-9"></a>Periods 4-9</h3><p>By the time I get to period 4 I can barely stay awake. I will probably end up dossing off at some point during class. 5th period is chem which it always gives me energy when I&#39;m with my friends. When it comes to my depressive episode they usually last a week or two. They best way for me to cope with them and get through them is to spend time with my friends. Though during the episode all i want to do is isolate myself which is so bad for me. After period 5 if it&#39;s a b-day I go to gym instead of double chem. Either way I happy because I get to spend time with my friends. Once 6th rolls around I get to eat and just sit alone in the cafiteria for two periods because double lunch. Last but not least I have math 9th and by then I&#39;m decently awake enough to not worry about falling asleep.</p>
<h3 id="Panick-Attacks"><a href="#Panick-Attacks" class="headerlink" title="Panick Attacks"></a>Panick Attacks</h3><p>This is all added to random panic attacks while I&#39;m walking through the halls. If they&#39;re really bad I&#39;ll end up just not going to class. It&#39;s only ever happened before chem or lunch thank god. These panic attacks usually just lead my to hyperventilate and just need to sit down. Though recently I did have a melt down in math. So that was cool.</p>
<h3 id="After-School"><a href="#After-School" class="headerlink" title="After School"></a>After School</h3><p>Usually during depressive episode I tend to skip clubs and go straight home to nap. This nap usually lasts until around 5 or 6 where I&#39;ll then have dinner. After dinner I&#39;ll consider doing my homework but even the thought of raising the pen to write makes me mentally breakdown. I usually end up skipping my homework and going to bed or using my computer till 10.</p>
<h3 id="Homework-and-Grades"><a href="#Homework-and-Grades" class="headerlink" title="Homework and Grades"></a>Homework and Grades</h3><p>I usually tend to get most of my deppresive episodes during 2nd quarter. I suspect this to be seasonal deppresion but I haven&#39;t done enough research to know. Though because of these episodes my grades in 2nd quarter are always the worst of the year as I normally hand in none of my homework and fail most of my tests. This year I am experincing the episodes like normal but keeping on top of my homework fairly well compared to normally.</p>

    <title>High School Anonymous Instagram Causes an Uproar</title>
    <url>/2021/12/13/High-School-Anonymous-Instagram-Causes-an-Uproar/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It started with an Instagram account where a student could submit photos of their fellow classmates sleeping. The anonymous account holder would then share these photos publicly putting them on display. Little did the student know this trend would blow up in the school. With over 6 different accounts all anonymousingly being created, this very quickly became a trend within a week. As a person who was posted on the hse<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> couples account I felt violated. Not only because someone is sneaking photos of me but also because I feel like I can do nothing about the photo’s existence. We asked the hse<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> couples account for a statement. When asked if posting these photos of others without their consent is a violation of their privacy they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ummm. i mean no. cause they at school. and it is a school page lol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sheer lack of understanding of how others may feel uncomfortable shows the lack of maturity of the person who runs this account. They are also breaking the law and school rules by doing something illegal on school grounds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you discover that someone posted either photos or videos of you or your family on a social media site without your permission, the first thing to know is that it is illegal. Keep in mind that every platform has a different privacy policy, so the individual that posts may think they did nothing wrong.”<br><a href="https://nyplaw.com/2018/09/13/can-a-person-take-legal-action-if-someone-posts-unauthorized-photos-or-videos-on-social-media/">https://nyplaw.com/2018/09/13/can-a-person-take-legal-action-if-someone-posts-unauthorized-photos-or-videos-on-social-media/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, students may not photograph, record, videotape, etc. any member of the Half<br>Hollow Hills community, including other students, or its guests without prior teacher and/<br>or administrative approval. Inherent in this statement is the prohibition of the distribution<br>of any type of material as outlined above.<br><a href="https://www.hhh.k12.ny.us/uploaded/HS_East/Handbooks/2021-2022_Student_Handbook.pdf">https://www.hhh.k12.ny.us/uploaded/HS_East/Handbooks/2021-2022_Student_Handbook.pdf</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that not only are they breaking law but also school rules without a care shows how this can easily get so much worse. On the hse<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> crushes account they posted on their story asking if instead of crushes they should share others secrets. This just goes to show how this can quickly go from creepy inappropriate talk about minors to cyber bullying on a large scale. I reached out to hse<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> crushes account in which they declined to comment on the current situation.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Zach and Joanna for helping me with this one!</p>

    <span class="spoiler-blur ">this isnt supossed to make sense. its not suppossed to be readable. its not suppossed to make gramatical sense. fuck sake i cant even spell suppossed. things that may be easy for tothers feel impossible for me. like spelling or understanding what im reading or even fucking writing. getting words down to paper to show what im thinking is thet hardest thing for me. thats why i challenged myself to do this blog weekly. for some reason all my thoughts are being warped. the best way to describe it is im a visual thinker and my thoughts right now are being warped like a calidascope. tbh i originally made this site to be professional to show to colledge and at this moment im realizing its just a good way for me to practivce figuring out my thoughts. speaking of right now the only way i can figure out how to cope with whatever is going on in my head is by smashing something with an sledgehamer. i have this toy train i used o play with as a kid. actually one time while trying to plug in the toy trains track i acidetally put my fingures on the two metal bits as i pugged it in. yah i guess you could say that was a shocking lesson. hhhh anyways i wanna take the train and smash it once everytime i feel the need to. it can be the representation of the trainwreck of my life. you know whats funny. i just realized anthing i write here will be imortalized forever. the way back macheine plus so many other platfrms added with anything i write will get commited on gthub. hhhhhhh idk i just cant think straight. its 336 am and i started writing this at 307 so idk. cool fact ig. i fucking hate discord tbh. oh and also i really want to smash the train rn my thoughts are going wonky again. i regret staying up. im finally getting tired but also still really anxious. its 348 lmaoooo. AHHHH ITS 411. its 6 am. ognna try and sleep now nini</span>
